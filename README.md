#In this image analysis process, we aimed to identify ripe and non-ripe areas of custard apples using a combination of color and edge detection techniques. To enhance the
detection process, edge detection using the Canny method was performed.This image analysis approach provides a reliable method for identifying ripe and non-ripe areas of 
custard apples based on their color and edge characteristics. Further improvements can be made by fine-tuning the range of color values and exploring different edge 
detection parameters.
